        <h2>Chinese Cuisine</h2>
        <p>
            Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, originating from various regions of China and
            Chinese communities worldwide.
            Due to historical influence, Chinese food has shaped many other Asian cuisines. Staples such as rice, soy
            sauce, noodles, tea, tofu,
            and utensils like chopsticks and the wok are now recognized globally.

            Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittsa]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually
            round, flattened base of
            leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various ingredients (anchovies, mushrooms,
            onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.).
            It is traditionally baked in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who
            makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
