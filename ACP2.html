    <img src="https://example.com/honeybee.jpg" alt="Honeybee" width="400">
    <p>Honeybees are flying insects known for their role in pollination and honey production. They are social insects
        that live in colonies with a structured hierarchy consisting of a queen, worker bees, and drones.</p>

    <h2>Types of Honeybees</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Queen Bee:</strong> The only fertile female in the colony responsible for laying eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Worker Bees:</strong> Female bees that perform tasks like foraging, cleaning, and taking care of the
            larvae.</li>
        <li><strong>Drones:</strong> Male bees whose primary role is to mate with the queen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Honeybees</h2>
    <p>Honeybees are crucial for agriculture as they pollinate many crops. They also produce honey and beeswax, which
        are valuable natural products.</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>Did you know? A single honeybee visits around 50-100 flowers during a foraging trip!</p>
